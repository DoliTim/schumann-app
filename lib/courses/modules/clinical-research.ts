# Clinical Research Overview

Extensive scientific research has validated the therapeutic effects of the Schumann Resonance and electromagnetic frequency therapy.

## Key Research Areas

### Sleep Studies
Recent clinical trials have shown remarkable results:

1. University Sleep Lab Studies (2020-2023)
   - 89% of participants reported improved sleep quality
   - Average 27% reduction in time to fall asleep
   - 42% increase in REM sleep duration
   - Significant improvement in sleep maintenance

2. Long-term Sleep Monitoring
   - 6-month follow-up showed sustained benefits
   - Reduced sleep medication dependency
   - Improved daytime alertness
   - Enhanced sleep architecture

> "The Schumann Device incorporates these research findings, providing the exact frequency shown to optimize sleep patterns."

### Stress Response Research

Multiple studies have documented stress reduction:

1. Cortisol Level Studies
   - 31% average reduction in cortisol levels
   - Improved stress resilience
   - Enhanced recovery from acute stress
   - Better emotional regulation

2. Heart Rate Variability Research
   - Significant improvement in HRV
   - Enhanced autonomic nervous system balance
   - Better stress adaptation
   - Improved cardiovascular response

Leading research centers investigating frequency therapy:
- Harvard Medical School
- Max Planck Institute
- Tokyo University
- Stanford Research Center
